# Sign Language Recognition System
The overall goal of this project is to build a word recognizer for American Sign Language video sequences, demonstrating the power of probabalistic models. In particular, this project employs [hidden Markov models (HMM's)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) to analyze a series of measurements taken from videos of American Sign Language (ASL) collected for research (see the [RWTH-BOSTON-104 Database](http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~dreuw/database-rwth-boston-104.php)). In this video, the right-hand x and y locations are plotted as the speaker signs the sentence.
